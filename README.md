# Effective-Management-of-Time-Series-Data

This project works best on existing time-series data.

Process of execution:

Download and execute the python files reduced.py and create_table.py
Reduced.py takes "end-date" and "TIMEINTERVAL" as system arguments.

The files resuced.py and create_table.py when executed on existing time series data in the idrac10 schema of different metric tables, results in around 95% reduction in volume and decreases the execution time to around 80%.

Python   : 3.11.2

Database : TimeSCaleDB
